# Data Structures implementation in C

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures written in C language, focusing on clarity, efficiency, and reusability.
Each data structure is implemented from scratch, following standard C89/C99 practices, and includes example usage to demonstrate basic operations.

---

## üß© Implementations

Includes the following data structures:

- Linked List (Singly, Doubly and Sorted)
- Stack
- Queue
- Heap (Priority Queue)
- Dynamic Vector
- Hash Table
- Tree (BST, AVL, Trie)
- Bit Array
- Circular Buffer
- Fixed/Variable Size Allocator

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Pure C implementation (no external libraries)
- Well-commented API
- Modular and reusable design
- Compatible with Linux / GCC and Visual Studio Code (Compile with c89/99)
- Note that some data structures are built on top of others to promote code reuse and modular design. 
  Each module‚Äôs API clearly documents its required dependencies.
  for example, Heap uses Dynamic Vector for internal storage.
